# POC-PON-Tchl-Analysis

This GitHub repository accompanies the manuscript of Maniaci et al. titled “Concentration and distribution of phytoplankton nitrogen and carbon in the Northwest Atlantic and Indian Ocean: A simple model with applications in satellite remote sensing”. It is designed to illustrate how the in situ data were processed and how the model is fitted to the data.

Regarding this data, we acknowledge the Bedford Institute of Oceanography, and all those involved in the collection of data.

The notebook can be run through a webpage, just click on the launch-binder image.
